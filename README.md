# A Python library for simulation KiCad schematics using Spice

## Overview

This libray is at a very early stage of development.  There are
probably lots of bugs, and only Device:R, Device:C, Device:L and
Spice-enabled components have been tested so far.

## Example

[test-ngspice.py](test-ngspice.py) shows how to run a simulation using
Ngspice from the command line.

For a more advanced example on how to use this library, see the output
from this [Jupyter Notebook](examples/butterworth/butterworth.ipynb).
Just about anything in the notebook can also be run directly from
Python and produce output in an interactive matplotlib window instead.

If you want to out the notebook yourself, follow the install
instructions below and then start the Jupyter notebook with:

```
jupyter notebook
```

If this doesn't work, try teling Jupyter not to start a browser and
then open the link that is printed in your preferred browser:

```
jupyter notebook --no-browser
```

## Prerequisites

I've been using the following libraries to run this:

* KiCad Version 5.0.0-rc2 nightly build as of 16 aug 2018
* Python 3.5 or Python 3.6 with pip
* Matplotlib 1.5.1 or 2.1.1
* Ngspice 26-1 or 27-1
* Jupyter Notebook =1.0.0
* ply

All this is running on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or 18.04 LTS.

I don't see any reasons why this shouldn't work on other Linux
distributions or even on Windows, but I haven't tried it myself.

## The Xyce and LTspice simulation engines

There is also some support for the Xyce and LTspice engines.

I downloaded and installed the Xyce binaries for Ubuntu 16.04 (they
won't work on Ubuntu 18.04) from here:

> https://knowm.org/comparing-simulation-results-of-the-knowm-m-mss-model-in-xyce-and-jspice-using-qucs-s/

Note that the butterworth schematic will not work with Xyce as is.
For some reason the LMV981 OP-amp model causes a "timestamp too small"
error when trying to simulate the circuit.  Switching to a different
OP-amp model such as the LMH6624 does work though.

LTspiceXVII was installed using Wine on Ubuntu 16.04.

## Installation

Follow the instructions here on how to install the nightly build of
KiCad on Ubuntu:

> http://kicad-pcb.org/download/ubuntu/

Python, matplotlib and Ngspice, pip are the versionsions that come
with Ubunutu and can be installed with:

```
apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-matplotlib ngspice
```

Jupyter notebook was installed using pip with:

```
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```

Ply was installed using pip with:
```
python3 -m pip install ply
```
